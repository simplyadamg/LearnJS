// Syntax parser inserts semicolon after return, this is a
// problem with automatic semicolon insertion
// Helpful to always put curley brackets directly after the end of function.


// Faking Namespaces
// Container for vars and functions JS doesn't use these because of the nature of objects in JS

//  First class functions
//  JS uses First class functions which call be passed around, created on the fly and generally used in the same way sas other types. 
//  Can be anonymous, or without a name.
//  Code: are where the actual lines of code sit.
//  The function is an object with many properties, code is one of those properties but it is not the funciton. 
//  code is invokeable function()

//  Function statment does work... A function expression creates a value that is not necessarly saved to a variable. 
//  Mutate - to change something and if it's immuitable that means it can't be changed
